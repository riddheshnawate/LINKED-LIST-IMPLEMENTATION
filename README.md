## TASK DESCRIPTION

The objective of this task was to create and implement a C program that demonstrates a singly linked list with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. This task was carried out to understand the concept of dynamic data structures and to learn how memory management is handled efficiently in C programming using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

In C programming, a linked list is an important data structure that allows dynamic storage of data. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a fixed size and can grow or shrink during program execution. Keeping this concept in mind, the task focused on implementing a singly linked list where each node contains a data element and a pointer to the next node in the list.

The program begins by defining a structure for the linked list node. Memory for each node is allocated dynamically using the `malloc()` function. The insertion operation allows new nodes to be added to the linked list. This operation helps demonstrate how nodes are linked together by adjusting pointers and how new data can be inserted efficiently without shifting existing elements.

The deletion operation removes a specified node from the linked list. During this process, the program carefully updates the links between nodes and frees the memory of the deleted node using the `free()` function. This ensures proper memory management and prevents memory leaks. Special cases such as deleting the first node or handling an empty list are also considered.

Traversal is another important operation implemented in the program. During traversal, the program moves through each node starting from the head and displays the data stored in the linked list. This operation helps in verifying the structure of the list after insertion and deletion operations and provides a clear view of the current contents of the list.

The program follows a modular and efficient approach by implementing each linked list operation as a separate function. This improves code readability, simplifies debugging, and makes the program easier to modify or extend in the future. Clear output messages are displayed to help users understand the operations being performed.

Overall, this task provided practical knowledge of implementing a singly linked list in C programming. It strengthened the understanding of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and data structure operations. The program successfully demonstrates a modular and efficient linked list implementation and serves as a foundation for advanced data structure applications.
